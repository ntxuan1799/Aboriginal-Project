northern territory addenda people were born out of these lands more than  years ago an ancient homeland now at the center of a national debate over who modern australia is and whose voice counts in it sharice buzacott brings her children to this community gathering so they can proudly express their culture through song and native tongue in a way that she found difficult growing up i didnt really have that sense of confidence around being aboriginal whereas now its sort of like growing into it and realizing how important it is and yeah just wanting to have my kids have that confidence and knowing who they are where theyre from how they connect to people before british invasion more than  indigenous languages lit up these lands today only  of them are considered strong why is it important to do that like why are we putting songs into language because its very important to keep our language and our kids really strong yeah yeah carry on all our stories carry on our stories like yeah like we did yeah as a gunai k ey and watch a bic man whose family was stripped of their native tongue through white australia assimilation policies i understand the importance of language but having censored our voices for generations theres now an intense debate on whether we should be heard australia is the only commonwealth country that doesnt have a formal agreement established with its first nations peoples and they say that constitutional recognition is the first step in addressing that original an ongoing sin will i gr up in a country that hears my voice that sin was the brutal dispossession and exploitation of indigenous lands waters and ways of life but with the government supporting the yes campaign is the country finally coming to terms with its history yes makes it possible sharice has been encouraged by the visible support for indigenous recognition for us this has been huge like to be able to see that support and it resonates with us and makes us feel like a okay actually we do have people that want the best for us infant and child mortality rates for aboriginal people double the rate of the rest of australias population sharice is one of the first aboriginal midwives in this community and her experience with state institutions means voting yes hasnt been an easy decision ive been really battling with um my own sort of mistrust in the systems with government with structures with being a midwife and working in a system that doesnt see culture it doesnt value language doesnt value first nations people for the knowledge and wisdom that weve held this you know  whatever thousand years whats the optimistic outlook if the referendum does sail through i feel like for me thats a display of solidarity like i feel like yes were here with you and and that acknowledgement of like yeah you know we did muck up in the past that acknowledgement of that history and also how can we move forward we dont really have much else you know like what else have we got other than the yes vote looking straight at me not everyone agrees aboriginal and tarist islander peoples comprise hundreds of politically distinct nations thank you very much and there are many that are railing against their own constitutional recognition including actor and activist natasha wangan im doing the sovereignty protest back home in adade so were not were not v voting were standing in our sovereign rights you cant convince people with badges our right natasha believes in selfdetermination and selfgovernment and thinks only indigenous people should be involved with deciding their collective futures in every community black or white theres going to be a range of people with different opinions and thats okay it it is thats everyones entitled to their opinion but i dont want  of the country whos not black voting on  of my people its not right my eyes yeah i see it as one big massive distraction from the destruction thats going on still you know how can we vote yes to become a part of a a nation thats destroying our history our our what everything that we are i dont see the point in that and you know everyone wants to be kumay around a fireplace its not going to happen when my peoples bones are still getting dug up when weve still got deaths in custody highest suicide rate for our youth and our men you know our women need help as well theyre the most dises respected people on earth unfortunately i grew up right down the road from australias  year history has been built on the systematic erasure of those already here our people continue to endure some of the worlds highest incarceration rates and deaths in custody are at a record high but as sharice looks to the future she hopes that her sons will have a brighter one im really hoping that were able to have a voice and that were able to be seen because i feel like if anything you know ariginal men and in particular ariginal boys theyre the ones that are mo most at risk if things dont go right or if were not able to be seen and heard so for me you know i really need to have a big focus on what the actions are going to be once the referendums over whatever the outcome of the

YouTube Auto-Transcript,Transcript of: Will the Voice to Parliament fix First Nations issues? | 60 Minutes Australia,it started as a simple and without doubt honorable thought the chance to do good to recognize indigenous australians in our constitution but then politics took over the proposed voice to parliament is now mired in complication and confusion with fear being used to fuel almost certain failure instead of being history making the referendum is set to be nation dividing so how and why did it come to this as the red dust beating sun and open road suggest were a long way from canberra and senator jacinta nampy gin per price couldnt be happier about it so whats it like for you coming back home the land and the people what does it mean to you its great its like having taking a big sigh as soon as i step off the airplane i breathe in that clean fresh desert air it is beautiful yeah music for jacinta the outback is the heart of australia but too often forgotten in the small northern territory town of tenant creek believe it or not this is the biggest day of the year a public holiday has been declared so everyone can enjoy the annual show lifes a lot different in places like tenor creek and there are a lot of problems and issues you know theres a lot of sense of powerlessness as well is in dagwood dogs might seem a strange place to talk politics but these are the communities the people the government promises will be heard and helped if the nation votes to change the constitution later this year the government wants indigenous australians to be recognized in our founding document and given their own voice to parliament but the null vote is way ahead with the shadow minister for indigenous affairs convinced the voice will only make life more difficult i think it would create more red tape and more processes to go through i think a lot of australians expect that most if not all indigenous communities would get behind the voice given that its this idea of having more power having more say in policies that affect everyone we dont all think as one homogenous group of people i think recognition most australians could get behind including myself but the fact that the voices latched on to this is deeply concerning because it is an absolute unknown entity we dont know what its functions are how itll operate how people will be appointed or elected in relation to first peoples should we not have the ability to give you advice standing up for first nations people has been a lifelong endeavor for noel pearson but hes on the other side of the debate leading the yes campaign history calls upon us to lead the aboriginal activist helped design the model for the voice which would say  indigenous australians elected to advise the government before it makes decisions affecting their communities this is a very modest idea and of all of the things that indigenous australia could ask of the rest of the country this is the most modest ask you know its saying put us in the constitution give us a ability to make representations to the parliament about the laws and policies made about us and that is the kind of recognition that we seek to be part of the australian commonwealth how would the voice change everyday life in practical daytoday terms well the voice helps us put the policies to the government because as long as governments been telling us what the policy should be they havent been working at town hall meetings around the country knowles on a mission to convince people to back the voice applause but so far its not working the polling is disastrous support for the yes campaign is at an alltime low of  with voters worried the voice will be ineffective or wield too much power when you do see some of that recent polling that shows the majority of australians would vote no what would change their minds what would change their mind is if we focus on the promise that lies in front of us i expect that the governments and parliaments of the future will listen to sensible advice whenever advice is provided that it is not sensible i expect the parliament and government to reject it as it should let me put some no concerns to you then well ive got you and these have come from literally people at the pub family members people have emailed us under the voice australians will have to pay a percentage of gdp to the voice every year absolutely nonsense rubbish rubbish okay australians will be forced to pay land tax royalties to the voice nonsense cant happen cant happen why not were not a decision maker here the parliament and the government are the decision makers the only people who can levy taxes or anything like that make policies is the government all the voice has is to make representations those are just outlandish fear campaign ideas from the outback to the city it seems theres one thing everyone can agree on so far billions of dollars in funding and decades of talking have failed to close the gap and the reality is the fate of indigenous australians who make up just three percent of the population is now in the hands of the rest of the country yeah my family before yes and why is that get involved get work and get a job instead of breaking and ending um stealing and doing something in tenant creek a lot of locals have no idea what the voice is we found the only people willing to speak on camera plan to vote yes regardless because help in any form is desperately needed what do you think the voice will do for your community um hopefully something if theyre gonna have to come in here and if theyre not going to have the committee wait some time senator just sent an ampijinpa price says plenty of people share her concerns about the voice but are too scared to declare it publicly you know a lot of nonindigenous australians feel like theyre going to be viewed as racist if they vote no and that to me is wrong you know there is a lot of good will in australia and thats what the us campaign are banking on that goodwill in the sense of even guilt because of our nations history and a way to sort of right wrongs as opposed to actually achieving anything of any practicality on the ground so if the voice to parliament is not the answer what is what is needed is is we need politicians to stand up and do their job because elected parliamentarians such as myself theres  of us are paid by the taxpayer to understand what those needs are on the ground and to advocate for them and if youre in government to actually act upon them so i think its a copout to suggest that the voice is going to be the beall endall for all our issues when we know what they are maybe not the be all and endall but isnt it a step in the right direction it hasnt been explained to me why its a step in the right direction the voice will play a fundamental role in terms of not allowing government kind of shift focus off these issues and leave them neglected out of sight out of mind what happens now if it fails what does that look like oh well have a major feeling of regret and sorrow at what we could have had and we didnt get there and we only have to look across the tasman to get an idea of what we could have if the referendum succeeds how does it work is it effective applause at new zealands parliament youd be hardpressed to find a more passionate kiwi than rawiriwatiti music hes so proud of his maori heritage its represented with great honor on his face music so in in our culture we call it moko this is my qualification its my curricular vitae its my its thats the cv if you look closely enough raw where is moko will tell you hes trusted to speak on behalf of all maori as the coleader of the maori party hes paying close attention to australias upcoming referendum to establish an indigenous voice to parliament because new zealand has a similar system and he cant imagine life without it whats good for indigenous is going to be good for everybody when the tide rises everything should rise with it the tide rises but some of us are in a kayak and some are in a cruise liner and so my thing is to to to australia to do the right thing its now time the rest of the world is watching unlike australia most developed democracies have a long history of formally recognizing their indigenous people from canada to finland to the netherlands and many believe this is the nation with the proudest record of all its been a push that maori people have sought since the s music donna hall is the most influential woman in married him and a lawyer for the maori council its an advisory body that lobbies the government to prioritize maori issues very similar to the voice proposed for australia its a national voice for maori to be able to articulate policy that affects all maori from housing health education law and maintenance what powered is that the maori council have well it has to persuade it has no formal uh ability to direct anyone and certainly not the new zealand government its ability to persuade is very large if the arguments are put carefully and if their right of their proper arguments most governments will actually listen there were dozens of buildings just like this called mares scattered around new zealand where maori communities gathered to discuss issues that affect them that feedback is passed up the chain to the maori council and then the federal government has it been well done do you think wed like it to work better what weve got weve worked hard for we have maori classes schools all over the country now that teach only and maori and that is an achievement today when you get on a plane and fly back to australia you will hear the uh air hostesses greet you in maori that is what the council has brought about and not just a recognition of of the culture but a celebration of it really a celebration and its great on top of the maori council new zealand also has a treaty and a law ensuring maori traditions like this are preserved foreign music seven seats are set aside for maori representatives rawiri watiti is one of them im interested to know if you feel your system works is it effective we still have a long way to go but that representation has allowed us to to at least find a voice to at least get some small gains by comparison what do you make of australias proposal which is essentially for an advisory body or or a voice to parliament it doesnt go far enough you know people like stepping stones one step at a time no and at the end of the day there is an example here in aotearoa in new zealand that you know that goes further than an advisory theres a lot of fear in australia about whether a voice could go too far well i dont think that australia needs to really think hard about a floodgates argument because the population of the aboriginal people is so small if theres one person who needs no convincing to get behind the voice its prime minister anthony albanese whos now facing one of the biggest tests of his judgment prime minister hi good to see you good to meet you thanks for coming give me the big sale why should australians support a voice to parliament because it will produce better outcomes what programs that have been successful have in common is that theyve had that sense of ownership from indigenous people themselves so its about that listening and getting better outcomes and recognition no one will be hurt by a yes vote in this referendum but his yes campaign is in big trouble the majority of australians plan to vote no you clearly have not been able to make a compelling case for the voice and if the pm cant do it i mean what chance does it have well constitutional change is hard in this country only eight propositions have been successful out of  but im confident that australians will take up this opportunity to vote yes prime minister wayne exactly what hes asking australians to vote for but he insists its very simple who will be on the voice and how will they be elected the bush will be elected by indigenous australians themselves it will consist of people from every state and territory and from the torres strait it will have some gender balance on the voice as well as well as making sure that young people are elected but if youve already got the indigenous voices in parliament consulting with the communities what how is this different we dont have a structured national program if we do the same thing we should expect the same outcomes and those outcomes are just not good enough but when you keep saying outcomes i think what people dont understand is what is a practical example of how an indigenous community or the life of an indigenous person could be changed by the voice a practical example is when community health programs have involved indigenous people themselves and theyve been listened to you have better health outcomes weve just spent a bit of time in indigenous communities alice springs tenant creek ive got to tell you a lot of the locals did not know what the voice is those who did couldnt explain how it would work or help them the fact is that a range of people have been disenfranchised from participation ive never supported the idea of having you know committee sitting in canberra this is absolutely risky and theres a very vocal group of highprofile indigenous people who are adamant the voice is not the answer we are saying no to the referendum and no to the voice will parliament be required to or obliged to listen to the voice therell be no writer veto what this does is provide for a constitutionally enshrined uh voice to parliament but one that doesnt overturn the parliamentary structures so whats its power then well its power is is the power of voice theres a bit of tension in that messaging though because on one hand youre saying this is a huge historic really significant change that we need and on the other hand it doesnt go too far it wont really substantially impact most peoples lives i mean how can both those things be true well it can be true because for most nonindigenous australians it wont impact the way that parliament functions the things that have a direct impact on their lives but it just might make it better for the most disadvantaged group in australian society for our indigenous australians anthony albanese is facing his first test as prime minister on just over a year into his first term the gloss is wearing off the albanese government the prime minister in a ukrainian war zone trying to comprehend the atrocities that took place as our globetrotting pm juggles foreign policy with a barrage of domestic woes what keeps anthony albanese up at nine what are you most worried about i think in the national events that are beyond our control the russian invasion of ukraine has had an impact on cost of living here with global inflation so issues like that but its a great responsibility that i feel my bad of being prime minister was something that growing up wasnt on my agenda far from it but its an incredible honor as well you got a lot of people coming to you with a lot of problems would you consider delaying this referendum until cost of living inflation all of those things are under control until it can be more of a priority well the legislation has been passed it went through the parliament with overwhelming support this is now in the hands of the australian people let me put it to you this way if labor was polling  and the liberal party had  percent would you call an election well did you go to the polls this is not about party politics this is actually about its a fair comparison no this isnt about party politics this is about improving the lives of indigenous australians but this is your credibility on the line prime minister well its not about me um its not about any politician well it is about you its youre the prime minister this is your product its your job to sell it if you want to win its a product that came from indigenous australians and its one that i support you keep saying to me this isnt your product it isnt your campaign youve been in politics a long time you know that if it fails of course its political and it will have an impact on your legacy either way im concerned about the impact on aboriginal and torres strait islander people that is my only concern do you have a plan b my plan is to be successful at this referendum and im determined undetermined to stand up for my values and i have faith in the australian people the prime minister says the voice to parliament is about bringing australians together and hes in that what everyone wants well i think in contrast its demonstrated that its split australia down the middle music for an idea that was intended to unite the nation theres no doubt it has in fact divided opinion even among our indigenous leaders coalition senator jacinta nabijinpa price is hoping the referendum wont succeed what i can say is as ive asked the government for can they guarantee this will impact one life or do anything to save one life and some of the response ive got is it provides hope well hope makes you feel warm and fuzzy but hope doesnt stop a kid from being sexually abused hope doesnt end the violence in communities hope doesnt feed a mouth you know weve got to be practical but is hope better than nothing well i dont think were dealing with nothing but noel pearson a fierce advocate for the voice still has hope and says failure is too terrible to contemplate we can only win with love theres no other way do you think theres enough love in australia i think theres enough love were asking you to trust us and were putting faith in you our faith is in you the australian people this is about our country and weve got to get it right hello im amelia adams thanks for watching  minutes australia subscribe to our channel now for our brand new stories and exclusive clips every week and dont miss out on our extra minute segments and full episodes of  minutes on nine nowcom dot a u and the nine now app,10/14/2023,YouTube,Transcript,Aboriginal,After,it started as a simple and without doubt honorable thought the chance to do good to recognize indigenous australians in our constitution but then politics took over the proposed voice to parliament is now mired in complication and confusion with fear being used to fuel almost certain failure instead of being history making the referendum is set to be nation dividing so how and why did it come to this as the red dust beating sun and open road suggest were a long way from canberra and senator jacinta nampy gin per price couldnt be happier about it so whats it like for you coming back home the land and the people what does it mean to you its great its like having taking a big sigh as soon as i step off the airplane i breathe in that clean fresh desert air it is beautiful yeah music for jacinta the outback is the heart of australia but too often forgotten in the small northern territory town of tenant creek believe it or not this is the biggest day of the year a public holiday has been declared so everyone can enjoy the annual show lifes a lot different in places like tenor creek and there are a lot of problems and issues you know theres a lot of sense of powerlessness as well is in dagwood dogs might seem a strange place to talk politics but these are the communities the people the government promises will be heard and helped if the nation votes to change the constitution later this year the government wants indigenous australians to be recognized in our founding document and given their own voice to parliament but the null vote is way ahead with the shadow minister for indigenous affairs convinced the voice will only make life more difficult i think it would create more red tape and more processes to go through i think a lot of australians expect that most if not all indigenous communities would get behind the voice given that its this idea of having more power having more say in policies that affect everyone we dont all think as one homogenous group of people i think recognition most australians could get behind including myself but the fact that the voices latched on to this is deeply concerning because it is an absolute unknown entity we dont know what its functions are how itll operate how people will be appointed or elected in relation to first peoples should we not have the ability to give you advice standing up for first nations people has been a lifelong endeavor for noel pearson but hes on the other side of the debate leading the yes campaign history calls upon us to lead the aboriginal activist helped design the model for the voice which would say  indigenous australians elected to advise the government before it makes decisions affecting their communities this is a very modest idea and of all of the things that indigenous australia could ask of the rest of the country this is the most modest ask you know its saying put us in the constitution give us a ability to make representations to the parliament about the laws and policies made about us and that is the kind of recognition that we seek to be part of the australian commonwealth how would the voice change everyday life in practical daytoday terms well the voice helps us put the policies to the government because as long as governments been telling us what the policy should be they havent been working at town hall meetings around the country knowles on a mission to convince people to back the voice applause but so far its not working the polling is disastrous support for the yes campaign is at an alltime low of  with voters worried the voice will be ineffective or wield too much power

to bring our nation together that we all support that aboriginal issues
need to be recognised need to be recognised
in our constitution for sure and then from that then we can
make all different decisions but if its not there
then it doesnt put any onus on it doesnt matter whos in government
about what we can do for aboriginal people we all need to come together as one in unity and first and foremost get that voice that yes vote into the constitution first its like taking little steps to make change once we get the yes vote in the constitution within this country then they all need to come back to the table and visit all the aboriginal communities and have representation from there  i think that this is a chance for us we have a labor party in power its not going to be there all the time and if nothing is done now i think i said were in for a long cold winter i think that with the debate going on
at the moment  whats risen its head is the old ugly racism thing theres too much
racism and negativity being projected you know in encouraging the no vote and if the government would have got it right with the consultation process and involved you know community
people and grassroots people instead of handpicking the socalled experts or the think tank as they called it
in the john howard era  that negotiation and discussion
might have been more positive well at this stage
im in two minds at the moment about it about the voice i sort of look back on things and the referendum didnt change anything i feel so thats why im in two minds at the moment ive got to look at it
very closely before i make my vote government have let down aboriginal people lots of times like i said
with the royal commission with closing the gap targets there are lots of recommendations
already in place why arent we you know going
through those processes first rather than creating a voice i think aboriginal people
already have a voice in this country its a scary thought
because i believe that you know all the communities are different all the nations are different and i think its our own
selfdetermination that will lift us up
and make our communities thrive its about mob and thats whats infuriating
about the voice and all the years that we were held by government legislations in a constitution
that didnt recognise us you know and not being allowed to vote and fighting
for the chance to vote and   now the voice will be decided not on
our say so but itll be the wider nonindigenous population that decides
whether this vote gets through just once i think that you know it wouldnt hurt
that if it was just an aboriginal vote let us decide for ourselves",10/14/2023,YouTube,Transcript,Aboriginal,After,"i think that its just an opportunity

there was previously a referendum in  to recognise indigenous australians in the constitution as part of a preamble it failed too among other things one of the criticisms was that it didnt involve consultation with indigenous australians on how they would like to be recognised in the constitution and it had been written by a small group led by john howard they also tried to put god in it and held it at the same time as the republic referendum with some speculation it was a tactic by the monarchists to bring down the republic referendum

the  preamble no campaign used the same if you dont know vote no slogan in their no campaign material source  

there was bipartisan labor and liberal support for constitutional recognition in some form at some times in recent history

in  it was a coalition government under malcolm turnbull who started the process to consult with indigenous australians on what they would want constitutional recognition to look like at that point in time you could say it was assumed there was agreement by both sides to include them in the constitution in some way that process resulted in the uluru statement from the heart as an output which called for the voice treaty and truth telling the voice should be included in the constitution so it couldnt be changed by either party

the uluru statement and specifically the voice was rejected by the coalition government in  as too radical and wouldnt be supported by the public so it was actually a coalition government prior to albo who started that process to say what or how should we do constitutional recognition and then when the ideas came back they rejected them

one was a preamble which was a nice introduction to the constitution a little foreword that recognised them among a list of other recognitions which was led by a conservativelnp government with little consultation it got voted down

 the order was wrong truthtelling obviously needed to come first hindsight is  since so many australians are clearly woefully ignorant about what has happened in this country and what continues to happen

 no referendum in australia has ever passed without bipartisan support knowing that it was a mistake to announce this on election night upon winning especially with dutton as the likely opposition leader  someone who will always lead with the negative albo should have known better he was always great at building consensus across the aisle that is what he should have done here before ever announcing it let it be a win for both parties 

 australia is in a costofliving crisis albo should not have led with this he could have done it later after costofliving legislation it is quite clear looking at the voting data that areas suffering the most from the costofliving crisis were more likely to vote no

 looking at how the campaigns went it seems as though it would have been wiser to legislate the voice to parliament first let it run for a couple of years and then enshrine it in the constitution once it was upandrunning and they could show some good data none of the stupid arguments about lack of detail and not knowing the implications would have worked if it had been done that way 

 the government introduced this as a win for themselves and then backed away from it the messaging was all over the place leadership from albo was terrible it was of course sad and rough timing that pat dodson got sick when he did as he would likely have been the lead on this they wheeled out other faces for it way too late they also seemed to throw several indigenous civil rights leaders to the wolves

 the government completely failed to grasp how social media algorithms work it didnt understand the negativity bias inbuilt into sm algorithms and the way that these platforms organically push negative materials to much wider audiences than positive materials it didnt understand that the no campaigns usage of negativity and humour would get infinitely more reach than their own nice hopeful content their sm game was not good the no campaign definitely won on socials

im an aussie and this is why i voted no  i believe its wrong and racist to give a group mandatory rights in the constitution based on race   doesnt matter what the race is 

aborigines are not worth any less or any more than any other aussie so i had a philosophical objection to the racism of the proposal and its wrong to constitutionally enshrine one race over another

we were told the voice to parliament will provide a platform for first nations communities to be heard and advise government on laws and policies impacting them 

there are already a gazillion indigenous advisory bodies that may or may not listened to 

a government that did not want the voice could simply change it to be a body of one that meets once every  years or whatever 

even a government that did want the voice can disregard it as if pleases 

i have no objection to lots of money being spent on aboriginal people or any australian who needs help  

but as i said yet another aboriginal advisory body that can be disregarded at whim to add to the many other aboriginal advisory bodies seems silly

a government that did not want the voice could simply change it to be a body of one that meets once every  years or whatever 

even a government that did want the voice can disregard it as if pleases 

i have no objection to lots of money being spent on aboriginal people or any australian who needs help  

but as i said yet another aboriginal advisory body that can be disregarded at whim to add to the many other aboriginal advisory bodies seems silly 

not to mention if the labour government really did want a voice they could have legislated one immediately just not have it in the constitution 

but they chose not to

uselessinfogoldmine,The Voice referendum failed and racism rose. Is misinformation responsible?,"that wasnt the only response i saw many nuanced responses these included

 it is completely understandable that many first nations people in this country mistrust government and any promises it makes
 first natjons people are not a monolith and we should not expect them to be so
 we should absolutely listen to the dissenters too listen to first nations dissenters and the supporters over white dissenters and supporters 
 there is never a  consensus in anything in politics however repeated surveys of the indigenous population found strong support for the uluu statement of the heart  much higher than anything in politics normally has
 the process which created the uluu statement of the heart was the biggest and longest indigenous consultation process in the history of this country i will post this in detail with paragraph breaks below it is too long for a dot point we can trust that this process is evidence of a broad consensus of support across all communities as opposed to a minority of loud voices 

here the process

over a month period the referendum council travelled to  different locations around australia and met with over  aboriginal and torres strait islander representatives they wanted to do more but they had to work within the limitations the coalition government put on them

those representatives had to speak for some  adult people obviously that isnt a perfect process every single person has their views and they are all equally valid however for the purposes of these talks delegates to the dialogues were freely chosen by their communities or their representative organisations with  of places at the dialogues reserved for traditional owner groups  for community organisations and  for key individuals 

the referendum council worked in partnership with a host organisation at each location to ensure the local community was appropriately represented in the process

 delegates were then selected from those  dialogues from across australia to attend the first nations national constitutional convention near uluru

there have been some valid critiques of this process for sure

however we should also note that the referendum council also ran a broader public consultation prior to the uluru convention to assess attitudes towards the creation of an indigenous voice to parliament there was a digital online consultation which was divided into five key topics each showcasing one of the five key options in the discussion paper a brief animated video was developed explaining the key features rationale and potential limitations of the proposal this content was then supplemented with infographics social media posts and short textual descriptions on the website there was a call for public submissions which were then accepted  people also participated in online and telephone surveys

the results were that of respondents said they supported providing this voice within the constitution a majority of participants supported all five reform options no public submission expressed support for a statement of acknowledgement in isolation from other reform options  rather a package of reforms was favoured there was strong support for the voice to parliament option and in particular emphatic agreement in the public submissions that aboriginal and torres strait islander people should have a say when parliament makes laws and policies relating to indigenous affairs

so the first nations national constitutional conventionwas held near uluru in may  where they focused on  guiding principles drawn from the  regional dialogue events 

prof gabrielle appleby a unsw law professor who served as technical advisor and attended  of the dialogues has confirmed the above and said delegates at uluru were not representing themselves they were representing what their dialogue had said

the referendum council said in its final report that the convention did not reopen the work that had been done in the dialogues but rather the task of the national convention was to bring together the outcomes from the dialogues in order to arrive at a consensus

again there have been critiques of the convention  the meeting simply couldnt include everyone and although local elders were included perhaps the meeting should have been more open to others to at least listen in especially those whose lands it was being held on and definitely more interpreters should have been present

it should also be noted that  of the  delegates walked out of the conversations in protest saying their concerns about loss of sovereignty and the lack of a formal guarantee of a treaty process were not being heard delegates like jenny munroe and fred hooper complained of the conversation being oneway confusion over some elements and complaints about the process the dissenting delegates were then joined by  supporters some of those delegates did end up returning that afternoon such as murrawarri man and dubbo delegate fred hooper who ended up supporting the final document

the council have been open about this they have spoken as the process as an open dialogue and noted that not everyone agrees with pat anderson saying this is a difficult conversation its inevitable that theres going to be some robust debate and were not going to all agree and some confusion but the fact is that i think that it was a small group that walked out most of the theres  people still in the room and will be in a position to deliver the outcome tomorrow

i do think it is important to note that it is nigh on impossible to get  consensus on anything particularly political matters and it is important to note what the dissenters are saying of course their critiques are valid they have merit but the majority there did then reach a consensus

at the end of the nd day of the convention delegates representing the  regional dialogues elected two members from their regions to form the uluru statement working group who were tasked with drafting a statement that captured the consensus of the meeting

the issue you should try to know is why the support dropped

and a big reason for the drop in support was the lack of detail

i view all of those as reasonable questions that the government and voice proponents should have been able and willing to answer

the issue you should try to know is why the support dropped

i pointed out why support dropped  it dropped because people are generally in favour of doing better for aboriginal people  but when the concrete proposal was made and people started thinking about it they moved to oppose it  the initial support was more of an illusion of support it wasnt real

and a big reason for the drop in support was the lack of detail

if the whole thing falls apart because someone questions it then it was a weak proposal being badly sold The Voice referendum failed and racism rose.

YouTube Auto-Transcript,Transcript of: Australia to vote in historic Indigenous Voice referendum,music mbanta collo known as alice springs situated in the sprawling remote land mass of australias northern territory addenda people were born out of these lands more than  years ago an ancient homeland now at the center of a national debate over who modern australia is and whose voice counts in it sharice buzacott brings her children to this community gathering so they can proudly express their culture through song and native tongue in a way that she found difficult growing up i didnt really have that sense of confidence around being aboriginal whereas now its sort of like growing into it and realizing how important it is and yeah just wanting to have my kids have that confidence and knowing who they are where theyre from how they connect to people before british invasion more than  indigenous languages lit up these lands today only  of them are considered strong why is it important to do that like why are we putting songs into language because its very important to keep our language and our kids really strong yeah yeah carry on all our stories carry on our stories like yeah like we did yeah as a gunai k ey and watch a bic man whose family was stripped of their native tongue through white australia assimilation policies i understand the importance of language but having censored our voices for generations theres now an intense debate on whether we should be heard australia is the only commonwealth country that doesnt have a formal agreement established with its first nations peoples and they say that constitutional recognition is the first step in addressing that original an ongoing sin will i gr up in a country that hears my voice that sin was the brutal dispossession and exploitation of indigenous lands waters and ways of life but with the government supporting the yes campaign is the country finally coming to terms with its history yes makes it possible sharice has been encouraged by the visible support for indigenous recognition for us this has been huge like to be able to see that support and it resonates with us and makes us feel like a okay actually we do have people that want the best for us infant and child mortality rates for aboriginal people double the rate of the rest of australias population sharice is one of the first aboriginal midwives in this community and her experience with state institutions means voting yes hasnt been an easy decision ive been really battling with um my own sort of mistrust in the systems with government with structures with being a midwife and working in a system that doesnt see culture it doesnt value language doesnt value first nations people for the knowledge and wisdom that weve held this you know  whatever thousand years whats the optimistic outlook if the referendum does sail through i feel like for me thats a display of solidarity like i feel like yes were here with you and and that acknowledgement of like yeah you know we did muck up in the past that acknowledgement of that history and also how can we move forward we dont really have much else you know like what else have we got other than the yes vote looking straight at me not everyone agrees aboriginal and tarist islander peoples comprise hundreds of politically distinct nations thank you very much and there are many that are railing against their own constitutional recognition including actor and activist natasha wangan im doing the sovereignty protest back home in adade so were not were not v voting were standing in our sovereign rights you cant convince people with badges our right natasha believes in selfdetermination and selfgovernment and thinks only indigenous people should be involved with deciding their collective futures in every community black or white theres going to be a range of people with different opinions and thats okay it it is thats everyones entitled to their opinion but i dont want  of the country whos not black voting on  of my people its not right my eyes yeah i see it as one big massive distraction from the destruction thats going on still you know how can we vote yes to become a part of a a nation thats destroying our history our our what everything that we are i dont see the point in that and you know everyone wants to be kumay around a fireplace

the most dises respected people on earth unfortunately i grew up right down the road from australias  year history has been built on the systematic erasure of those already here our people continue to endure some of the worlds highest incarceration rates and deaths in custody are at a record high but as sharice looks to the future she hopes that her sons will have a brighter one im really hoping that were able to have a voice and that were able to be seen because i feel like if anything you know ariginal men and in particular ariginal boys theyre the ones that are mo most at risk if things dont go right or if were not able to be seen and heard so for me you know i really need to have a big focus on what the actions are going to be once the referendums over whatever the outcome of the referendum aboriginal people do agree on this its time for us to reclaim our rightful place i think,10/14/2023,YouTube,Transcript,Aboriginal,After,music mbanta collo known as alice springs situated in the sprawling remote land mass of australias northern territory addenda people were born out of these lands more than  years ago an ancient homeland now at the center of a national debate over who modern australia is and whose voice counts in it sharice buzacott brings her children to this community gathering so they can proudly express their culture through song and native tongue in a way that she found difficult growing up i didnt really have that sense of confidence around being aboriginal whereas now its sort of like growing into it and realizing how important it is and yeah just wanting to have my kids have that confidence and knowing who they are where theyre from how they connect to people before british invasion more than  indigenous languages lit up these lands today only  of them are considered strong why is it important to do that like why are we putting songs into language because its very important to keep our language and our kids really strong yeah yeah carry on all our stories carry on our stories like yeah like we did yeah as a gunai k ey and watch a bic man whose family was stripped of their native tongue through white australia assimilation policies i understand the importance of language but having censored our voices for generations theres now an intense debate on whether we should be heard australia is the only commonwealth country that doesnt have a formal agreement established with its first nations peoples and they say that constitutional recognition is the first step in addressing that original an ongoing sin will i gr up in a country that hears my voice that sin was the brutal dispossession and exploitation of indigenous lands waters and ways of life but with the government supporting the yes campaign is the country finally coming to terms with its history yes makes it possible sharice has been encouraged by the visible support for indigenous recognition for us this has been huge like to be able to see that support and it resonates with us and makes us feel like a okay actually we do have people that want the best for us infant and child mortality rates for aboriginal people double the rate of the rest of australias population sharice is one of the first aboriginal midwives in this community and her experience with state institutions means voting yes hasnt been an easy decision ive been really battling with um my own sort of mistrust in the systems with government with structures with being a midwife and working in a system that doesnt see culture it doesnt value language doesnt value first nations people for the knowledge and wisdom that weve held this you know  whatever thousand years whats the optimistic outlook if the referendum does sail through i feel like for me thats a display of solidarity like i feel like yes were here with you and and that acknowledgement of like yeah you know we did muck up in the past that acknowledgement of that history and also how can we move forward we dont really have much else you know like what else have we got other than the yes vote looking straight at me not everyone agrees aboriginal and tarist islander peoples comprise hundreds of politically distinct nations thank you very much and there are many that are railing against their own constitutional recognition including actor and activist natasha wangan im doing the sovereignty protest back home in adade so were not were not v voting were standing in our sovereign rights you cant convince people with badges our right natasha believes in selfdetermination and selfgovernment and thinks only indigenous people should be involved with deciding their collective futures in every community black or white theres going to be a range of people with different opinions and thats okay it it is thats everyones entitled to their opinion but i dont want  of the country whos not black voting on  of my people its not right my eyes yeah i see it as one big massive distraction from the destruction thats going on still you know how can we vote yes to become a part of a a nation thats destroying our history our our what everything that we are i dont see the point in that and you know everyone wants to be kumay around a fireplace its not going to happen when my peoples bones are still getting dug up when weve still got deaths in custody highest suicide rate for our youth and our men you know our

Jedi1196,My Experience as Someone who Voted Yes in the Voice to Parliament Referendum,"let me say this as an australian who happens to be white with high functioning autism living in a beautiful country that is home to the oldest continuing cultures in the world i am happy to be living in australia i have also learned to reconcile the fact that where i live was invaded and the invaders had disempowered a whole race of people

growing up i learned a little bit about indigenous australian cultures when my school teachers read to me and my classmates dreaming stories in the form of childrens books such as the quinkins by dick roughsey and percy trezise and when the snake bites the sun by david mowaljarlai i also learned through some songs such as from little things big things grow by kev carmody and paul kelly and yothu yindis treaty there was even a recording of the story of tiddalik the frog that play school once did i cant forget the days when i learned about the indigenous flag and what the colours meant and not to mention uluru the largest rock in the world there was even a time when an aboriginal couple came to my school and played their music while also teaching me and my classmates

by the time i was in high school i was taught about the stolen generations and other terrible things that the colonisers did to the indigenous peoples the film rabbitproof fence was even part of that learning i even learned about the significant achievements in indigenous history such as the wavehill walk off which led to the first legislation that allowed first nations people to claim land title and the mabo case that rejected the idea of terra nullius and recognised that first nations people were here long before colonisers

at the same time though during lunchtime and recess me and my classmates often used racist and ableist language which at the time we thought of as harmless banter is now clear to me that it has both directly and indirectly caused harm in my final years of high school there were some indigenous kids who i met but didnt know personally but through some stories from friends at school i learned that some of them had it rough not getting to know them is one of my many regrets from my school years



the dreaming is something that i have been fascinated with since childhood and along with reading various novels it has inspired me to write my own stories some of which take inspiration from the dreaming at the same time though it is something i try to be very careful with after learning about issues of cultural appropriation and the various issues indigenous australians face today certain stories that i read about i have tried to avoid since they would be sacred to some indigenous australians i even acknowledge my inspiration because to me it is good manners

it was after high school that i learned even more about the issues that first nations peoples face such as the higher suicide rates the poorer living conditions the big gap in life expectancy and the deaths in custody

but after giving some background information it is time to get to my experiences during the lead up to the referendum the aftermath and what i have learned and to those who voted no i am not here to criticise you or cast blame on you this is simply about my experience as a yes voter



when i heard that there was going to be a referendum on recognising aboriginal and torres strait islanders by establishing a voice to parliament i was optimistic and so was everyone else in my family and that was one of the key reasons apart from a dislike for scott morrison that i helped to vote the coalition out

that same year as the referendum i was finishing my music degree and also writing a fantasy novel inspired by some dreaming stories and indigenous languages during the university break i focused most of my attention on my novel

at first i did not give much thought on the no campaign and i was confident and hopeful that the referendum would be successful after anthony albaneses election which made me think that people were waking up to the lies that the murdoch media spreads i knew it was something that wasnt going to fix every issue but i always saw it as something that would be a stepping stone to even greater outcomes for first nations people 
looking back after one year it was naive on my part that the election of someone in favour of change would mean another success a year in to his term

due to my focus of finishing my degree i didnt have the time to participate in the yes campaign but from watching the news i was appalled when i found the reasons why some would vote no the words of jacinta price warren mundine and opposition leader peter dutton i couldnt help but cringe at and i went to various places online carefully searching for the right information to make sure that i wasnt being misled how in the world could they say that the referendum would create division or a new apartheid when the nation was already divided

the dont know vote no slogan was something which i thought was giving people terrible advice the proper thing to say would be dont know find out which people like former prime minister malcolm turnbull said but no

one day a pamphlet from the no campaign came in the mail and the first thing i did was rip it up and dump it in the rubbish

the news also showed me the fear mongering tactics that the no campaign was using and what the tiktokers were doing thankfully i am not a tiktok user and i did not waste time on any of that brain rot content

as time went on i saw the news showing the statistics of the referendum support it led to me feeling concerned that it wasnt going to be a success but i still had hope looking at how several aussie celebrities were showing their support i did not see a legitimate reason why the referendum wouldnt be successful especially after bands such as midnight oil and sport legends such as johnathan thurston threw their support behind the voice i saw some no voters on facebook who commented on one of midnight oils posts which showed their support and i was appalled at how many of them there were they claimed to be fans of their music but criticised them for going woke and supporting a divisive referendum which led me to seriously doubt they were really fans and if they have actually listened to their songs

a few months before the referendum i showed my support by wearing a yes badge when i went to university and others in my family did the same we even placed a big yes sign at the front of our home and waved to the yes campaigners as we drove to do the shopping

the week the referendum was going to be held me and my sister went to vote early i accepted a no pamphlet as i walked into where to cast my vote as a courtesy but also met the yes campaigners and enthusiastically accepted their pamphlets

when i went inside to vote i printed yes in capital letters to make my vote as clear as possible before placing it in the ballot box when i walked outside i didnt mind telling the yes campaigners i voted yes and they showed how grateful they were i headed home on my own while my sister stayed for a bit to talk to some no campaigners and i cant forget hearing the guy on his bike going up and down the street spreading the word in favour of the yes campaign

the next few days i continued to wear my badge and i felt proud of myself for doing so i dont consider myself a good debater but the no people did not scare me i had a jam session with my father and friends playing music and discussing various issues including the referendum the night before the day of the voice referendum

the day of the referendum i was confident that it would prevail and i thought about wearing my badge again but i felt that i had done enough

but later i receive the news that the voice had been overwhelmingly rejected i couldnt tell you how angry i was and i couldnt get to sleep at night

when i came home i did throw my yes badge across my bedroom out of frustration but then i retrieved it and put it in some place safe

on my next day at uni i expressed my feelings of disappointment to one of my teachers who sympathised with me as she supported the voice as well

after a few days my anger subsided and i have done my best to move on from the voice but to this day as of writing about my experience i am still pretty frustrated at the failure of the referendum



a few months later i had finished writing my novel which is still in the process of getting published as of this writing but around that time a terrible thing happened a young woman of indigenous decent committed suicide in the neighbours backyard at first when me and my family heard the yelling we dismissed it as nothing more than silly carryingon but by the time we realised what it was my father and sister went out to help i stayed inside because i didnt want to hold anyone back since the police and paramedics arrived at the scene all i did was observe through the shutters of my window

despite the best efforts of everyone at the scene it was no good the young woman aged  had died afterwards my sister came back inside highly emotional and my mother made the suggestion that the rejection of the voice played a part but the family who lived next door was already quite dysfunctional before it happened so no doubt there were other issues at play after hearing what my mother said i wondered if i was seeing the damage done by saying no



ever since the voice referendum i have taken the time to learn even more about indigenous australian cultures and have continued to look at the dreaming i have even taken the time to write another novel a science fantasy about the voice referendum which in a way has come out of me being angry with the failure of the referendum

despite this i have learned important lessons from the failed referendum as someone who is fascinated with the dreaming i have realised that i cannot continue to write stories inspired by it without also acknowledging the issues that indigenous australians continue to face which has led me to read more about indigenous history i want them to know that they have an ally in me in fact one of my goals is to ask a first nations artist to illustrate one of my stories and even draw a map for the fantasy world in one of my novels

i have also chosen to investigate the reasons why there are some people out there who choose to deny the existence of the stolen generations despite extensive documentation on the matter i personally find the claims that there werent any large scale removals for purely racist reasons to be disturbing its no different from denying that the holocaust happened
it was also naive on my part that celebrity support for the voice would mean that it would mean success i had underestimated the no campaigns tactics 

if i wasnt working on a novel or my music degree during the lead up to the referendum i would have participated more in the yes campaign but then again i dont believe my efforts alone would have made a difference

the referendum has led me to discover things about indigenous australians that i didnt know previously and has led me to seek out other places of interest

the news of south australias legislated voice and victorias treaty talks has given me hope that things will get better for indigenous australians moving forward at the same time as of writing this with a queensland election on the way i am worried about what will happen to the treaty talks when it is over


i write this story after reading thomas mayos always was always will be if i hadnt read the book i would not be doing this i learned a lot from the book and i would recommend that anyone reading this story check it out i would like to thank him for helping me to understand what is going on and what i can do moving forward thank you for taking the time to read my story about my experience as a yes voter and i hope that moving forward a difference can be made

update its been almost a month since i made this post and i have to say it does not surprise me what kind of reactions there would be what was meant to just be a post sharing my experience as a yes voter in the voice referendum turned into a debate over indigenous issues and what they are actually experiencing it was not intended to be some satirical piece the fact that someone even thought that is just bizarre and yet indigenous issues were all that was talked about no one talked about the fact that an indigenous person who lived near me took her own life no one showed much interest in other aspects of the post the fact that no one mentioned or cared that i talked about someones death indicates that maybe they did not read all of my post or that they were afraid of being insensitive or maybe they just did not care at all which would speak of a deeper issue 

but moving on this piece was not intended to criticise no voters or bring shame on them its not about who is right or who is wrong it is just about my experience as a yes voter ",10/12/2024,Reddit,Post,Aboriginal,After,"let me say this as an australian who happens to be white with high functioning autism living in a beautiful country that is home to the oldest continuing cultures in the world i am happy to be living in australia i have also learned to reconcile the fact that where i live was invaded and the invaders had disempowered a whole race of people

the dreaming is something that i have been fascinated with since childhood and along with reading various novels it has inspired me to write my own stories some of which take inspiration from the dreaming at the same time though it is something i try to be very careful with after learning about issues of cultural appropriation and the various issues indigenous australians face today certain stories that i read about i have tried to avoid since they would be sacred to some indigenous australians i even acknowledge my inspiration because to me it is good manners

it was after high school that i learned even more about the issues that first nations peoples face such as the higher suicide rates the poorer living conditions the big gap in life expectancy and the deaths in custody

but after giving some background information it is time to get to my experiences during the lead up to the referendum the aftermath and what i have learned and to those who voted no i am not here to criticise you or cast blame on you this is simply about my experience as a yes voter



when i heard that there was going to be a referendum on recognising aboriginal and torres strait islanders by establishing a voice to parliament i was optimistic and so was everyone else in my family and that was one of the key reasons apart from a dislike for scott morrison that i helped to vote the coalition out

that same year as the referendum i was finishing my music degree and also writing a fantasy novel inspired by some dreaming stories and indigenous languages during the university break i focused most of my attention on my novel

at first i did not give much thought on the no campaign and i was confident and hopeful that the referendum would be successful after anthony albaneses election which made me think that people were waking up to the lies that the murdoch media spreads i knew it was something that wasnt going to fix every issue but i always saw it as something that would be a stepping stone to even greater outcomes for first nations people 
looking back after one year it was naive on my part that the election of someone in favour of change would mean another success a year in to his term

due to my focus of finishing my degree i didnt have the time to participate in the yes campaign but from watching the news i was appalled when i found the reasons why some would vote no the words of jacinta price warren mundine and opposition leader peter dutton i couldnt help but cringe at and i went to various places online carefully searching for the right information to make sure that i wasnt being misled how in the world could they say that the referendum would create division or a new apartheid when the nation was already divided

the dont know vote no slogan was something which i thought was giving people terrible advice the proper thing to say would be dont know find out which people like former prime minister malcolm turnbull said but no

one day a pamphlet from the no campaign came in the mail and the first thing i did was rip it up and dump it in the rubbish

the news also showed me the fear mongering tactics that the no campaign was using and what the tiktokers were doing thankfully i am not a tiktok user and i did not waste time on any of that brain rot content

as time went on i saw the news showing the statistics of the referendum support it led to me feeling concerned that it wasnt going to be a success but i still had hope looking at how several aussie celebrities were showing their support i did not see a legitimate reason why the referendum wouldnt be successful especially after bands such as midnight oil and sport legends such as johnathan thurston threw their support behind the voice i saw some no voters on facebook who commented on one of midnight oils posts which showed their support and i was appalled at how many of them there were they claimed to be fans of their music but criticised them for going woke and supporting a divisive referendum which led me to seriously doubt they were really fans and if they have actually listened to their songs

a few months before the referendum i showed my support by wearing a yes badge when i went to university and others in my family did the same we even placed a big yes sign at the front of our home and waved to the yes campaigners as we drove to do the shopping

the week the referendum was going to be held me and my sister went to vote early i accepted a no pamphlet as i walked into where to cast my vote as a courtesy but also met the yes campaigners and enthusiastically accepted their pamphlets

when i went inside to vote i printed yes in capital letters to make my vote as clear as possible before placing it in the ballot box when i walked outside i didnt mind telling the yes campaigners i voted yes and they showed how grateful they were i headed home on my own while my sister stayed for a bit to talk to some no campaigners and i cant forget hearing the guy on his bike going up and down the street spreading the word in favour of the yes campaign

the next few days i continued to wear my badge and i felt proud of myself for doing so i dont consider myself a good debater but the no people did not scare me i had a jam session with my father and friends playing music and discussing various issues including the referendum the night before the day of the voice referendum

the day of the referendum i was confident that it would prevail and i thought about wearing my badge again but i felt that i had done enough

but later i receive the news that the voice had been overwhelmingly rejected i couldnt tell you how angry i was and i couldnt get to sleep at night

when i came home i did throw my yes badge across my bedroom out of frustration but then i retrieved it and put it in some place safe

on my next day at uni i expressed my feelings of disappointment to one of my teachers who sympathised with me as she supported the voice as well

after a few days my anger subsided and i have done my best to move on from the voice but to this day as of writing about my experience i am still pretty frustrated at the failure of the referendum



a few months later i had finished writing my novel which is still in the process of getting published as of this writing but around that time a terrible thing happened a young woman of indigenous decent committed suicide in the neighbours backyard at first when me and my family heard the yelling we dismissed it as nothing more than silly carryingon but by the time we realised what it was my father and sister went out to help i stayed inside because i didnt want to hold anyone back since the police and paramedics arrived at the scene all i did was observe through the shutters of my window

despite the best efforts of everyone at the scene it was no good the young woman aged  had died afterwards my sister came back inside highly emotional and my mother made the suggestion that the rejection of the voice played a part but the family who lived next door was already quite dysfunctional before it happened so no doubt there were other issues at play after hearing what my mother said i wondered if i was seeing the damage done by saying no



ever since the voice referendum i have taken the time to learn even more about indigenous australian cultures and have continued to look at the dreaming i have even taken the time to write another novel a science fantasy about the voice referendum which in a way has come out of me being angry with the failure of the referendum

despite this i have learned important lessons from the failed referendum as someone who is fascinated with the dreaming i have realised that i cannot continue to write stories inspired by it without also acknowledging the issues that indigenous australians continue to face which has led me to read more about indigenous history i want them to know that they have an ally in me in fact one of my goals is to ask a first nations artist to illustrate one of my stories and even draw a map for the fantasy world in one of my novels

i have also chosen to investigate the reasons why there are some people out there who choose to deny the existence of the stolen generations despite extensive documentation on the matter i personally find the claims that there werent any large scale removals for purely racist reasons to be disturbing its no different from denying that the holocaust happened
it was also naive on my part that celebrity support for the voice would mean that it would mean success i had underestimated the no campaigns tactics 

if i wasnt working on a novel or my music degree during the lead up to the referendum i would have participated more in the yes campaign but then again i dont believe my efforts alone would have made a difference

the referendum has led me to discover things about indigenous australians that i didnt know previously and has led me to seek out other places of interest

the news of south australias legislated voice and victorias treaty talks has given me hope that things will get better for indigenous australians moving forward at the same time as of writing this with a queensland election on the way i am worried about what will happen to the treaty talks when it is over


i write this story after reading thomas mayos always was always will be if i hadnt read the book i would not be doing this i learned a lot from the book and i would recommend that anyone reading this story check it out i would like to thank him for helping me to understand what is going on and what i can do moving forward thank you for taking the time to read my story about my experience as a yes voter and i hope that moving forward a difference can be made

update its been almost a month since i made this post and i have to say it does not surprise me what kind of reactions there would be what was meant to just be a post sharing my experience as a yes voter in the voice referendum turned into a debate over indigenous issues and what they are actually experiencing it was not intended to be some satirical piece the fact that someone even thought that is just bizarre and yet indigenous issues were all that was talked about no one talked about the fact that an indigenous person who lived near me took her own life no one showed much interest in other aspects of the post the fact that no one mentioned or cared that i talked about someones death indicates that maybe they did not read all of my post or that they were afraid of being insensitive or maybe they just did not care at all which would speak of a deeper issue 

but moving on this piece was not intended to criticise no voters or bring shame on them its not about who is right or who is wrong it is just about my experience as a yes voter  My Experience as

EternalAngst23,My Experience as Someone who Voted Yes in the Voice to Parliament Referendum,"thank you for sharing i must admit i voted no to the voice referendum i am well aware of the many challenges facing indigenous australians and of the wide gaps in health wealth education and life expectancy however i must also admit that if i were given the opportunity to vote for or against the voice my answer would still be no

i have never been opposed to the idea of a voice to parliament upon learning of the referendum following albaneses election i was yet to make up my mind although i was fairly confident that i would wind up voting yes however when the draft constitutional amendments were released in mid  that is when my opinion began to harden and not in a good way

for context im also a uni student however i study public policy and international relations i dont pretend to understand all the intricacies of constitutional law although it does form a pretty major part of my studies insofar as it determines the political structures of most states

when i first read the draft wording of the voice amendments my immediate reaction was that it was vague and i mean really vague i realise that this is was a fairly common criticism of the voice and that many yes campaigners equated it to the no detail arguments commonly made by the likes of peter dutton and jacinta price but it does not diminish the fact that as far as most constitutional amendments go the wording was incredibly short and very much open to interpretation i read a number of articles both for and against the amendments but even high court justices were divided over the wording some claimed it was watertight while others claimed it was lacking

albanese and his working group could have made the proposal a lot more detailed if they wanted to but what albanese feared most was a repeat of the  referendum where john howard deliberately overwhelmed voters with unnecessary detail on the model best seen in the question wording in the hopes that the australian people would defer to a no vote  and he was right

however by seemingly going for a smalltarget strategy albanese opened the voice debate up to all sorts of misinformation and disinformation as well as some valid criticism for instance what would formally constitute a representation to what extent could aboriginal and torres strait islanders make representations how would the executive government be defined who would it be limited to to what extent would the government be able to implement the restraint clause in paragraph  without undermining the provisions of  paragraph 

of course constitutional law isnt black and white and you will always get different answers depending on who you ask however this doesnt diminish the fact that albanese and his government were attempting to establish a body that would ideally have considerable influence and give considerable agency to all those of indigenous descent but they were trying to do so in three sentences

naturally most people were skeptical and this manifested in the results on the night of october the th perhaps if they had legislated the voice first and let it run for a year or so before putting it to a referendum then people would have been more receptive that way the voice would have been tried and tested and people would have had a chance to see it in operation before voting on it think of it as a try before you buy type of situation

unfortunately most australians are weary of any drastic changes to the constitution or our way of life thus when albanese and all the other yes supporters couldnt convince them they voted no its also a lot more difficult being on the yes side its an uphill battle as you are the one who has to advocate for change instead of keeping the status quo which the vast majority of people are already comfortable with  even if they may be uncomfortable with the truths about this nations history

as such any push for constitutional change requires a careful balance not too much information that you overwhelm the public and heighten their suspicions and not too little information so as to open the door to all manner of mischief and misinformation this is where the voice fell flat

in the future perhaps twenty or thirty years hence if a government wants to have another crack at the voice to parliament or something similar they would do well to demonstrate to the public that it could function effectively and efficiently without impeding good government if they do this and the voice operates the way it was first intended then maybe  just maybe  the australian people would be willing to enshrine it in the constitution

for context im also a uni student however i study public policy and international relations i dont pretend to understand all the intricacies of constitutional law although it does form a pretty major part of my studies insofar as it determines the political structures of most states

when i first read the draft wording of the voice amendments my immediate reaction was that it was vague and i mean really vague i realise that this is was a fairly common criticism of the voice and that many yes campaigners equated it to the no detail arguments commonly made by the likes of peter dutton and jacinta price but it does not diminish the fact that as far as most constitutional amendments go the wording was incredibly short and very much open to interpretation i read a number of articles both for and against the amendments but even high court justices were divided over the wording some claimed it was watertight while others claimed it was lacking

albanese and his working group could have made the proposal a lot more detailed if they wanted to but what albanese feared most was a repeat of the  referendum where john howard deliberately overwhelmed voters with unnecessary detail on the model best seen in the question wording in the hopes that the australian people would defer to a no vote  and he was right

however by seemingly going for a smalltarget strategy albanese opened the voice debate up to all sorts of misinformation and disinformation as well as some valid criticism for instance what would formally constitute a representation to what extent could aboriginal and torres strait islanders make representations how would the executive government be defined who would it be limited to to what extent would the government be able to implement the restraint clause in paragraph  without undermining the provisions of  paragraph 

of course constitutional law isnt black and white and you will always get different answers depending on who you ask however this doesnt diminish the fact that albanese and his government were attempting to establish a body that would ideally have considerable influence and give considerable agency to all those of indigenous descent but they were trying to do so in three sentences

naturally most people were skeptical and this manifested in the results on the night of october the th perhaps if they had legislated the voice first and let it run for a year or so before putting it to a referendum then people would have been more receptive that way the voice would have been tried and tested and people would have had a chance to see it in operation before voting on it think of it as a try before you buy type of situation

unfortunately most australians are weary of any drastic changes to the constitution or our way of life thus when albanese and all the other yes supporters couldnt convince them they voted no its also a lot more difficult being on the yes side its an uphill battle as you are the one who has to advocate for change instead of keeping the status quo which the vast majority of people are already comfortable with  even if they may be uncomfortable with the truths about this nations history

as such any push for constitutional change requires a careful balance not too much information that you overwhelm the public and heighten their suspicions and not too little information so as to open the door to all manner of mischief and misinformation this is where the voice fell flat

in the future perhaps twenty or thirty years hence if a government wants to have another crack at the voice to parliament or something similar they would do well to demonstrate to the public that it could function effectively and efficiently without impeding good government if they do this and the voice operates the way it was first intended then maybe  just maybe  the australian people would be willing to enshrine it in the constitution

i also think that the problem was the differences between the city and country vote where the yes campaign failed to address the regional voter base resting on the idea that the cities would carry the vote i feel this alienated the regional voters in some ways making it about the city elites vs the rest something again very easily harnessed by the no campaign

 lack of bipartisan support while there was longstanding bipartisanship for constitutional recognition this broke down in the referendum
 labor did not take a sufficiently bipartisan approach to the matter  they basically issued an ultimatum to the coalition to support the referendum rather than both major parties coming to an agreed position or any other more consensusbased approach
 establishing the voice was not perceived by voters as something in the national interest rather it was seen as a sectional interest particularly because much of the provoice framing went along the lines of this is what indigenous australians want rather than this will benefit australia as a whole

and then you have the people with absolutely no education at all the people who showed up to polling places and had to decide on the spot about changing the constitution or not doing that these people will always exist in a mandatory voting system you cannot force people to study politics in their free time they have every right to block it out so you need a strong campaign to counteract these voters

lots of people will blame things like racism a minority group of peoples or theyll blame protest voting that people werent happy with labor and voted against the voice out of spite but those really just dont hold up as arguments because most people dont vote like that

most people just didnt know and those that did know werent exactly that united in thinking the statement and subsequent voice were the best things ever i voted yes myself and i did so not because i agreed with the voice or statement not at all but because i disagree with the status quo of australia and id rather vote for something different than maintain it this is certainly a minority way of thinking and definitely isnt enough to save any sort of yes vote

and really it all just falls back on labor doing a terrible job bipartisan support was not necessary thats an unfounded belief just because something has historical precedent doesnt make it true its a crutch by lazy political analysts who just want to say things that sound like they would be relevant if a proposal was popular and well known it will win without the oppositions support labor made no attempts to make the voice either for instance why didnt the voice get made via a legislated voice to parliament rather than a constitutional one imagine if the build up to the referendum had a fully functioning vtp operating the whole time and rather than a referendum to create something and put it in the constitution we upgraded the already existing voice to constitutional status this was such an obvious solution to educate people with labor had a year to demonstrate it and they didnt

part of me thinks labor intentionally sank it labor doesnt actually want treaty or truth they just wanted the good boy points for fighting for it doesnt matter if their fight didnt have any punches they still fought for it they then got to turn around to first nations peoples and say yeah so australia said no sucks to be you because were not trying again vote labor

this sovereignty is spiritual notion the ancestral tie between the land or mother nature and the aboriginal and torres strait islander peoples who were born therefrom remain attached thereto and must one day return thither to be united with our ancestors this link is the basis of the ownership of the soil or better of sovereignty it has never been ceded or extinguished and coexists with the sovereignty of the crown

how could it be otherwise that peoples possessed a land for sixty millennia and this sacred link disappears from world history in merely the last two hundred years

with substantive constitutional change and structural reform we believe this ancient sovereignty can shine through as a fuller expression of australias nationhood

proportionally we are the most incarcerated people on the planet we are not an innately criminal people our children are aliened from their families at unprecedented rates this cannot be because we have no love for them and our youth languish in detention in obscene numbers they should be our hope for the future

these dimensions of our crisis tell plainly the structural nature of our problem this is the torment of our powerlessness

we seek constitutional reforms to empower our people and take a rightful place in our own country when we have power over our destiny our children will flourish they will walk in two worlds and their culture will be a gift to their country

from about halfway through the campaign it became obvious how progressives would play their hand  shaming people does not work  it only makes them dig deeper

when will the western left learn that this tactic only works on people already on the left  over and over again we have seen this tactic fail  and yet i suppose due to the large amounts of smug it generates will continue to be used stupidly

if people spent less time trying to outmoralise each other and actually focus on discussion with those we disagree with maybe then can we make firm changes  i say that knowing full well it will never happen  whatever the cause be it social media virtue culture or what have you it seems we are well past the point of being able to sit down and discuss serious issues without deriding each other

yes there were  dyed in the wool racists voting no  absolutely no doubt about it  but to paint everyone with that brush was a huge mistake and exercise in ignorance of the highest order

the so called educated seem to have very few people skills  i suppose you dont need them when you surround yourself with those who automatically agree with you and those you can brow beat into your position

so many who voted no stayed quiet out of fear of being called ignorant misinformed or racist  if the proponents of the yes vote hadnt behaved the way they did then minds could have been changed  if those in opposition are afraid to discuss why they are choosing a particular path then your flavour of progressivism has failed  dramatically

but like i said earlier there will be no soul searching no consideration of a different approach in the future  there will be recriminations and finger pointing and disappointment at australia

YouTube Auto-Transcript,Transcript of: The votethat will change Australia: Inside the Voice referendum | Four Corners,aboriginal and torres strait islander viewers are advised that the following program contains images and voices of people who have died applause on october  you will be asked to vote yes or no to change our constitution applause i want to recognize aboriginal and torres strait islander people through a voice to parliament the prime minister anthony albanesi says this is a simple question a matter from the heart applause this is your time your chance your opportunity to be a part of making history it will be a moment of national unity music but for many the debate has been unsettling were taking  million people with us in this change journey thats a lot of people thats a hell of a big you know ask this referendum wont change who we are it will reveal who we are whatever the outcome our country will be different on the monday after the ballot paper doesnt begin to capture the complexity of this conversation music we dont need to embed this in our constitution in such a way that it creates a rift you know youre going to have a large part of the population now seen as an isolated group of people with privileges that the other people dont we live these issues and are impacted by them daily whatever they may be child protection issues justice issues youth detention youth incarceration housing it does not make sense any longer for others to be making those decisions without us oh this is the colony we are a dumpster file the idea that the people who stole this land and then those who have directly benefited from it and now going to a referendum to think about recognizing the people who they stole it off is insane im heading to the far west northern tip and east of australia to hear how first nations people are dealing themselves into democracy and if the voice can deliver on its commitments to address the disparities some indigenous people face music how do you think australians are going to vote in the referendum is anybodys guess i suppose music thank you ive been coming to the gamma festival in arnhem land for years music its one of those rare occasions in australia where indigenous affairs are front and center music music applause music its a cultural festival but also a lobby fest where the powerful mix this year its all about the voice music applause music thank you applause this is the first gamma without you know pingu he was the head of the gumach nation and the major force behind reviving constitutional recognition for first nations people applause music today his words will echo in those songs music music music music had the ear of the powerful and used it to advocate for first nations people hence music at gamma last year after the announcement there would be a referendum on a voice he had a simple question for the th prime minister he had dealt with face to face are you serious this time the answer was a straight yes i am applause music the question that australians will be asked at this years referendum will read a proposed law to alter the constitution to recognize the first peoples of australia by establishing an aboriginal and torres strait islander voice do you approve this proposed alteration thats the question before the australian people music for some its a modest simple request youre the yoda man ian ham is a member of the stolen generation adopted as a baby he didnt know his birth family lived just  kilometers down the road from the country town he grew up in until he was an adult music for me its not about the uluru statement its not about sovereignty its not about advocacy what do you as an australian believe in your heart of hearts when you vote should the aborigines your fellow australians be able to speak i use the term aborigines because the way the discussion has been happening about this referendum there are days when im not sure if its  or its  ian is the director of the australian institute of company directors one of the many corporate groups that make the journey to gamma each year i am god hoping it reveals that were a nation thats maturing were progressing were coming to terms with our own history i dont actually accept the argument that you know companies and business should stay within the swim lanes and just look after their their business we all exist um in a context i have a question around whether ian spent his adult life working to reform the systems that govern indigenous peoples lives if aboriginal australia is fully embraced think of the contribution we can make not only about ourselves but to making australia better country as a whole thats what this referendum is about so much more than just closing gaps music the official no camp argues the voice will divide the country so when you hear your name thats your cue the stand up but theres also resistance from those who say its too small a request people like gunai kunai man ben abbottangelo a former professional cricketer whose view on the voice is moved from a reluctant yes to a hardedged no ladies and gentlemen youre welcome dan borsche well its born out of whats acceptable for constitutional conservatives its not born out of black ambition what do you say to those who say that this is a step in that journey of a rights agenda its not and we dont have time this go slow incremental change is killing us the first step like how mediocre is that  years plus of brutal subjugation i dont want to take a small step in quicksand with my feet tied together i want to lift this up out of it i want to dream and remember what it is like to live freely autonomously independent and um you know i want to maintain my dignity in pursuing that vulnerable woman social justice commissioner june oscar hopes the voice will limit indigenous people being used as a political football we must remind ourselves that this has been a journey this call has come from decades upon decades of so many indigenous leaders and we have had some of our best minds indigenous and nonindigenous people contributing to that but politics has been everywhere in this debate music applause and the yes campaign has a hard road to sell its case applause for a referendum to pass it must be supported by a majority of voters nationally and reach a majority in at least four states but both sides are fighting for peoples attention amidst the cost of living crisis music walgett in remote northwestern new south wales is among the states most socially disadvantaged towns but its residents are about to get apprised delivery camilleroy couple gary and jenny trindle organized this delivery of fresh fruit and veg and so who do these boxers go to whoever wants them anyone in the community that wants them gets them its important isnt it community its very very important when youve got a little rural place like walton its very very important that we do everything together and well work together i think after weve gone to get the bread you want my truck gary is the chair of the moody  working party in walgas an indigenous organization that practices what he calls turnup democracy local solutions to meet the communitys needs parallels have been drawn with how the voice to parliament could work  working parties were in the muddy parking regional assembly and its a collection of people from all the little communities out here im the chairperson goes away three times a year to the muddy parking regional assembly meeting our chairperson is there we tell him whats going on in our communities and what we need then he goes and will be his government for us and im the chairperson but i dont do anything in this community unless the community tell me to do it yeah thank you very much enjoy thank you thatll keep you set for a little while really hard at the moment ive got myself as a diabetes and my son as a diabetes as well and fresh fruit and veg is really important so what happens when you cant get that or you cant afford that might do what we got to really be hard story and they have to charge through the nose with their prices which is not their fault its the way of living these days in the costume does this make you feel like youre part of the community thats because the whole community is being invited there you know and thats the great thing about it its not just for aboriginal and torres strait islanders for everyone and its nice to see other people coming here garys taking us on a tour of walgett the town hes called home for the past  years theres a lot of people out there less fortunate than us havent got the drive that me and my family have got and theyre the people that we need to help a lot of people fear to come here because its got a bad reputation back in the late s i was in accolade with the new south wales police yes it was a volunte town but now theres no one on the street no it might be an odd kid but thatll be about all so from the reputation that it had to what its got now i feel is really a credit to the wilder people well ill be honest with you ive had about three nights where ive had probably two or three hours sleep in the last week because i thought this wasnt gonna go the way that it was planned but the third go off the way that it went off this morning i think ive ground  foot tall youre saying it with your own eyes like wildwood police walgett ambulance walbert fire brigade and other people were just walking up to me and say gary can we helped i think its brought this town the relations between aboriginal and nonaboriginal i think its brought this town ahead  years really today yep modipaki serves a region that covers around  percent of the state where more than  percent of residents are aboriginal gary says moody parking knows what locals need and it delivers so how does that line up with the voice this is the worst thing dan theyre trying to put something on us and not telling us what its going to be and i will not support that i will not support people that are living in sydney to make decisions for me and my family listening to you about murray parkey im wondering well isnt that essentially a possibility to be a local regional voice that then feeds in so issues that are coming out of wall get come through you to your chair and then go to thats right that national body thats exactly right but your voice is only as good as the person thats representing you what gary hints at here is a recurring theme as skepticism or lack of trust that the proposal would make things better um sort of in between at the moment but i think ill vote yes anyway because if we can make good changes then so be it if its going to benefit our communities then weve all got to be in it and im even talking about knowing everybodys on people too weve all got to come together start telling the truth about whats happened in the past learn from it go forward why is that important to tell the truth and to learn from it for you well my father was taken as part of the stolen generation and is still affecting our family  government houses have been built in the town for aborigines and another  are to be completed and tenanted this year music vics story is the reality for many indigenous families where history is present every day music he was living on a mission with his parents and he went down looking for turtle eggs to get breaky foot for the family you know and the cobbles come along and took it and thats why theres a lot of angst with with police still today you know that um that blue uniform it was represents a lot and a lot of thats not good its only just now that we found proof that he was actually in kindred with that there was a lot ahead for a lot of years because you know we didnt know what would happen to him in the past isnt that really affected us as a family foreign music the voice dividers provided a platform for truth telling about our dark past but also stories of incredible resilience does rivers were community that brought community together on my side of riverwood across is around about  years ago we have a massacre so what happened was over  plus of our people were massacred for no reason at all they were blamed for killing a man that was even dead now  australia became known as a federation of states and all the talk of that time was australia is now spreading its wings and its expanding while australia was spreading its wings and its expanding for our people it was shrinking now if you look straight out you can see like a kidneyshaped storage tank come up and well do a bit more eh get your fans out because this is the best spot number people dont these fish traps to the time the land was created generations of member and other language groups have used and cared for them for thousands of years i think its sort of coming to me that a lot of what the europeans did to the aboriginals was actually taking their culture away and it wasnt just accidental so obviously what bradley said you know changed their location and stopped them practicing hunting and gathering so it was a deliberate attempt to wipe out their culture so the fish traps originally went  meters back up past that we are our people would use that rock to sharpen their tools and weapons for hunting see that flat rock down the bottom here were having a big national conversation right now about our past how we reconcile that and understand that now i wonder where do you see us on on the voice i feel um ignorant music yeah what i should vote because there doesnt seem to be a lot of detail i hear of indigenous groups who are really for it others that are dead against it um and i really just dont i dont know what im going to vote because i dont feel that ive got enough information um i think its important but i dont know what the right thing to do is what happens the day after if the vote is incredibly close or its not what we expect as a nation well its a really good question yeah its a really hard question um i mean it does seem that there is an element of divisiveness in the whole thing at the moment its not sort of bringing people together its um you know sort of driving a wedge i think for bay im definitely going to vote yet hopeful that it will be a vote for yes and i think that would be a really monumental change for australia and it would be a good step forward in reconciliation and i think enshrined in the constitution allows that it will continue despite what politics plays or what parliament does and i think that that is going to be a really big change here likes so much of australia people are focused on the daytoday of life paying the bills getting the kids to sport applause music applause foreign music had their first five children of the ten children that mum ended up having music and thats where we lived um on on the on the riverbank music ive had  children five boys and five girls and ive got a  grannies and great grannies and great great grannies even now like im semiretired nimble woman grace gordon has lived in and around brewerina all her life we were actually all came under the aboriginal protection act um at that time right up until  lots of different aboriginal grace found her voice in social welfare reform establishing womens safe houses shes had a lot of frustrating experiences trying to get support for local solutions its left her with a strong suspicion of government and its structures mark youre welcome here to my country which isnt nearby country and id like to pay my respects to our elders past and present and our young and emerging leaders that are coming through oh thank you so much grace so i was actually involved in this for quite some time around the establishment it was the first womens safehouse model which is a different model to the normal womens refuges and we had locations in lightning ridge wildgatt ruarana burke and wilkinia it was very personal for me you know um i i myself you know i was a victim of domestic violence and when that was happening to me we didnt have these types of services out in these remote communities women didnt really want to be you know putting their men in jail they didnt like the violence they wanted the violence to go away so we thought if we developed a model like this when the women knew that things were going to start to escalate that the women could ring and say you know wed like to come in for the weekend so you broke rules in order to protect women the policies and guidelines around places of that size was that you could only take at any one time six or seven people and as you know many of our first nation families that could be one woman thats got that number of children we did we we broke the rules if we needed to bring in  women we would bring them in and theyd sleep on the floor as the chair of moody parking ruarana grace can see indigenous voices need to be heard by decision makers but is skeptical about what an enshrined voice will deliver but if theres um so i would like to see more of people from our remote communities being i suppose involved in the hierarchy if you want to call it that and to be able to take our voices really to the table to get some real traction and real outcomes to be devils advocate is that what a voice to parliament is well well thats what theyre perceiving it to be but i still dont see that its in what we see as a real voice to parliament music there are road maps everywhere with answers to local problems have a beautiful day at school okay good morning music jason ford has wrestled with the best way forward my position on the voice to parliament is uh ive been directed by my direct elder um to vote now um and thats it is finished thats not once my elder tells me something ive got to respect what they say regardless i dont ask questions about that has that been complex or tough for you because well i know that youre a yes supporter yeah yeah well i look look i suppose you know like its its today is pretty complex you know and its something of me being able to showcase to my nieces and my nephews and that allows our family group to showcase you know that we still have that continuity to our nearby culture and our elders you know i just got to respect my culture and my elder and thats just the way it is how are you going to feel the day after the referendum ill feel for the people that have worked so hard to try and improve things for the people i feel for them if it doesnt get up and um and ill be happy for him if it gets up its the same point you know if it gets up ill still be happy for them because i respect what theyve done i just hope it doesnt change the way people treat us in a negative way hypers are positive outcome and either way either way music on the other side of the country in northern western australia other issues are muddying the waters northerns a great place weve got baladon history here for over   years and weve got european history almost for  years its a beautiful mural here oh its absolutely fantastic done by jackson stone wellknown artist chris antonio is northern shire president i grew up on the farm out of town so youre a little bit isolated from everything to be honest i think it was a racist town but i think that wasnt from any malicious intent it was just from ignorance people didnt know our history it wasnt taught at schools and we just didnt know and that was a lot of the population thank you applause this is a big weekend for the town today is the start of the avon river descent an annual twoday race from northern to perth i hope that you have an amazing race you are part of history this is the th avenue descent the avon descent is a community event davis is here to bless the river before the race begins when we go for a swimmer when you think we always throw sand into the water and thats to let the rival know that were going into his domain no one knows what hes looked like this just does like a rainbow serpent and he lives in this river down the rise before i wish you the best if its your first time good luck music weve worked really hard on embracing our cultural heritage and weve also made it possible to be comfortable to have uncomfortable conversations northerns maturing debate made it ready for the voice proposal music then earlier this year the west australian government introduced new legislation aimed at protecting aboriginal cultural heritage it was meant to prevent the type of destruction mining company rio tinto caused in  when it blew up duke and gorge a racing   years of indigenous heritage music but the new laws made no one happy so their interests and concerns and the government repealed them after only five weeks it was never the intention the failure of the new laws has cast a shadow over the voice debate in the west please show some respect here applause and normally nationals member of parliament for the central wheat belt mia davies is a northern local and a member of western australias opposition very early on in the pace i could see people linking the two and i tried very hard to make the point to the government that the way they were going about it was was creating confusion and chaos and setting people against the the broader debate around the voice that was dismissed we were called racist in the debate we were told that we were conflating the two issues but we could see that was happening on the ground in the community and it was making it harder to have those conversations without a doubt some people play on that politically i was trying to actually keep the two issues separate tony seabrook farms up river of northam in his role as president of the wa pastoralist and graziers association seabrook was instrumental in the campaign that overthrew the cultural heritage law hes been here since day dot our family cleared the country i have a very deep sense of attachment to my piece of country it was a mound in the ground when i was a child as tony shows me around his property he notes the hardships of early pastoralists that family had a child that was scolded the child died on the way to town and i buried that baby just outside the walls of the house place where that house was where that baby that the child was buried is that a special place have you protected that i have never been there without thinking of whats here so i could take you to within a very close distance of where the child is buried but unfortunately the ring of stones that were there were taken away whose feelings have parallels with how first nations people in the west regard their sacred sides do you know if there are any first nations sites of interest on your property and i have been over every inch of this farm and i can tell you right now i havent found a single thing that would indicate that there had been any indigenous presence here at any time in the past i couldnt find one im an absolute advocate for the preservation of heritage but this concept of um mythical serpents and while i start to have a problem when this cultural belief impinges upon the sorts of things that i as a farmer need to do and id encompass that with everybody that owns land applause the heritage act roused campaigners such as tony to insist their concern to be heard your organization the wa partialists and gracie is association has a voice to parliament youre incredibly influential do you see a parallel between what the voices we have a we fight we fight for every inch of of their play and influence that we have isnt that what a voice to parliament would be a place where aboriginal torres strait islander people can have the fight so that theyre heard the way that you are i dont think anyone can say no ones listening everybody is listening this is a tokenistic gesture that wont change anything music mia davies led her party when the wa nationals decided to back the voice proposal the same week the federal party voted to oppose it its heartened that our party was prepared to have that debate and that there were people that wanted to see change in the way that we did aboriginal policy for the betterment not only of aboriginal people but for our whole nation shes concerned that the abandoned heritage actors cast a shadow over the voice debate theres no doubt that the aboriginal cultural heritage act has made it more difficult for people to consider whats being asked of in the referendum and thats really disappointing last month the local party fell into line with the federal no position you and i have talked about some of the really intractable challenges that some aboriginal torres strait islander people face one of the reasons used to justify the voice is that there needs to be a new way of trying to deal and address those matters we need to address this but we dont need to add it to the constitution this is a simple thing that the legislation is there today to do that theres nearly five percent of the federal parliament that is indigenous the population of australia deems itself to be indigenous a bit over three percent theyre not unrepresented if anything the people that represent them and call themselves indigenous are letting them down what do you mean by those that call themselves indigenous well theres a big problem here you know youve been up north and you clearly know what someone that is indigenous looks like but we dont have any way here today in australia of saying if someone says theyre indigenous thats it they are but theres a threepoint test and is anyone going to contest that is anyone going to contest the fact that someone call themselves indigenous i think its challenged every day i make the simple argument that what were doing now is simply not working and ive seen that in every corner of western australia and we will only get one chance i think to recognize aboriginal people in our constitution yes yes i will be voting yes athletes coming across the line after two days of racing the avon descent ends here in suburban perth competitors are spent from the effort but if its a metaphor for the voice campaign it ends there that result is still far from clear music s music again to stay at the finish line in this year battling out for line honors so ive never proclaimed and i dont have a decision of yes or no i want to see more information so i can make my mind up when i think its relevant and all the information is in front of me music if the cultural heritage act is a lesson in how not to do policy reform examples exist of how to do things better wa southwest native title agreement known by many is the noongar treaty shows how real consultations can lead to tangible outcomes colin barnett was the liberal premier who signed the deal man brendan moore now helps ensure it delivers music its not a small deal that was negotiated and i think its a great pity now that were finding with the voice that it has turned into a divisive political debate i think thats very damaging we have to look at whats at stake and things like the voice its its really is as simple advisory group and as weve seen in the southwest of western australia weve got what is essentially a treaty and this guy hasnt fallen in we actually were the first nation in australia to win native title in  over a capital city our sites and our artifacts have been covered by a european cover but its still just beneath the surface you dont have to scratch very far  of western australias population live on nunga land only a handful of years ago an entire skeleton was discovered underneath a perth suburban footpath completing the crouch position facing the sun which is a traditional ancient burial custom of the noongar people the normal people number around thirty thousand one of the largest cultural groups in australia steam they surrendered their native title rights in exchange for resources and recognition negotiated with government and i was incredibly impressed with the courage of the noongar people to make that decision at the heart of it was the fact that the native title act was going to deliver ancient rights you know thats the right to hunt the right to gather and the right to collect ocher and it was on slithers of land that was left over by agriculture leftover by industry and that government didnt want we were better served by an alternative settlement that would make us engage into a modern economy were an urbanized people from an ancient culture cultural heritage assessments like the one brendan is doing here preserve nunga culture for everyone so why im grinding what am i looking for if i say anything were looking for artifacts were looking for any sort of cultural material from the old days tony seabrooks property is on longer country but was not affected by native title anyone knows anything about it at all but it was signed over during the last years of the barnett government or liberal government in western australia a  billion dollars worth of transferred wealth there   square kilometers of land and probably encompassing about   people this is this is a huge decision to have taken by government and and a very empowering thing for the new people what would the prevailing politics a few at the time certainly a motive for aboriginal people it was a big deal a lot of people said to me its taking a long time five years of negotiation is a long time my response was understand for nungo people this is the one roll of the dice it was very well thought out very detailed and expensive but worth it i think that time has has sort of healed healed a lot of people im sure theres theres still a lot of people that are sad about about the um surrendering of their their inalienable rights however a lot of people have come to realize the benefits that were now seeing from the nungabuja trust weve now got a over  million dollars in the trust watchmen brendan moore and colin barnett agree the southwest settlement offers a lesson for the voice debate and can ask him what happens the day after the referendum if its a successful outcome well i think i think itll be an amazing moment itll be amazing moment for the country and itll be an amazing reconciliation moment aboriginal people asking for this is its not a political party asking for this so itll mean that aboriginal people feel heard immediately and i think thats a wonderful moment what happens the next day if the australia votes know i think itll be very difficult time for all of australia but particularly for aboriginal people i will vote yes but i do so with doubts because if i i would i think the question is flawed but i will vote yes because i dont want to stand in the way the aspirations of aboriginal australians music whatever path australians travel to reach their answer the outcome will play out here the ballot paper isnt big enough to contain all the questions raised in this debate but whatever answer it does deliver will set the foundations for the next steps as a nation i think we are set either way for some bad times ahead but i think itll be a regenerative moment and if that no vote comes through and you know bushfire will come through and itll ravage the entire scene but you know you come back to that site six months later  months later and you see that green bursting through settle the business settle the score thank you it feels like we have this great opportunity now we are capable of getting it right now so id like to think that we can address this now in our generation and not leave it for our children and grandchildren to struggle with and do more harm than good lets just work out a way to resolve issues that are there and put the referee into one side because its just its not going to end up happily for everybody it just wont twice in my lifetime my countrymen will get to judge my worth as a human being that is heavy heavy for us but its a heavy thing for the rest of australia to think about and its got to think about it seriously and not with these superficial distractions that are happening from the yes and no case music applause music,10/14/2023,YouTube,Transcript,Aboriginal,After,aboriginal and torres strait islander viewers are advised that the following program contains images and voices of people who have died applause on october  you will be asked to vote yes or no to change our constitution applause i want to recognize aboriginal and torres strait islander people through a voice to parliament the prime minister anthony albanesi says this is a simple question a matter from the heart applause this is your time your chance your opportunity to be a part of making history it will be a moment of national unity music but for many the debate has been unsettling were taking  million people with us in this change journey thats a lot of people thats a hell of a big you know ask this referendum wont change who we are it will reveal who we are whatever the outcome our country will be different on the monday after the ballot paper doesnt begin to capture the complexity of this conversation music we dont need to embed this in our constitution in such a way that it creates a rift you know youre going to have a large part of the population now seen as an isolated group of people with privileges that the other people dont we live these issues and are impacted by them daily whatever they may be child protection issues justice issues youth detention youth incarceration housing it does not make sense any longer for others to be making those decisions without us oh this is the colony we are a dumpster file the idea that the people who stole this land and then those who have directly benefited from it and now going to a referendum to think about recognizing the people who they stole it off is insane im heading to the far west northern tip and east of australia to hear how first nations people are dealing themselves into democracy and if the voice can deliver on its commitments to address the disparities some indigenous people face music how do you think australians are going to vote in the referendum is anybodys guess i suppose music thank you ive been coming to the gamma festival in arnhem land for years music its one of those rare occasions in australia where indigenous affairs are front and center music music applause music its a cultural festival but also a lobby fest where the powerful mix this year its all about the voice music applause music thank you applause this is the first gamma without you know pingu he was the head of the gumach nation and the major force behind reviving constitutional recognition for first nations people applause music today his words will echo in those songs music music music music had the ear of the powerful and used it to advocate for first nations people hence music at gamma last year after the announcement there would be a referendum on a voice he had a simple question for the th prime minister he had dealt with face to face are you serious this time the answer was a straight yes i am applause music the question that australians will be asked at this years referendum will read a proposed law to alter the constitution to recognize the first peoples of australia by establishing an aboriginal and torres strait islander voice do you approve this proposed alteration thats the question before the australian people music for some its a modest simple request youre the yoda man ian ham is a member of the stolen generation adopted as a baby he didnt know his birth family lived just  kilometers down the road from the country town he grew up in until he was an adult music for me its not about the uluru statement its not about sovereignty its not about advocacy what do you as an australian believe in your heart of hearts when you vote should the aborigines your fellow australians be able to speak i use the term aborigines because the way the discussion has been happening about this referendum there are days when im not sure if its  or its  ian is the director of the australian institute of company directors one of the many corporate groups that make the journey to gamma each year i am god hoping it reveals that were a nation thats maturing were progressing were coming to terms with our own history i dont actually accept the argument that you know companies and business should stay within the swim lanes and just look after their their business we all exist um in a context i have a question around whether ian spent his adult life working to reform the systems that govern indigenous peoples lives if aboriginal australia is fully embraced think of the contribution we can make not only about ourselves but to making australia better country as a whole thats what this referendum is about so much more than just closing gaps music the official no camp argues the voice will divide the country so when you hear your name thats your cue the stand up but theres also resistance from those who say its too small a request people like gunai kunai man ben abbottangelo a former professional cricketer whose view on the voice is moved from a reluctant yes to a hardedged no ladies and gentlemen youre welcome dan borsche well its born out of whats acceptable for constitutional conservatives its not born out of black ambition what do you say to those who say that this is a step in that journey of a rights agenda its not and we dont have time this go slow incremental change is killing us the first step like how mediocre is that  years plus of brutal subjugation i dont want to take a small step in quicksand with my feet tied together i want to lift this up out of it i want to dream and remember what it is like to live freely autonomously independent and um you know i want to maintain my dignity in pursuing that vulnerable woman social justice commissioner june oscar hopes the voice will limit indigenous people being used as a political football we must remind ourselves that this has been a journey this call has come from decades upon decades of so many indigenous leaders and we have had some of our best minds indigenous and nonindigenous people contributing to that but politics has been everywhere in this debate music applause and the yes campaign has a hard road to sell its case applause for a referendum to pass it must be supported by a majority of voters nationally and reach a majority in at least four states but both sides are fighting for peoples attention amidst the cost of living crisis music walgett in remote northwestern new south wales is among the states most socially disadvantaged towns but its residents are about to get apprised delivery camilleroy couple gary and jenny trindle organized this delivery of fresh fruit and veg and so who do these boxers go to whoever wants them anyone in the community that wants them gets them its important isnt it community its very very important when youve got a little rural place like walton its very very important that we do everything together and well work together i think after weve gone to get the bread you want my truck gary is the chair of the moody  working party in walgas an indigenous organization that practices what he calls turnup democracy local solutions to meet the communitys needs parallels have been drawn with how the voice to parliament could work  working parties were in the muddy parking regional assembly and its a collection of people from all the little communities out here im the chairperson goes away three times a year to the muddy parking regional assembly meeting our chairperson is there we tell him whats going on in our communities and what we need then he goes and will be his government for us and im the chairperson but i dont do anything in this community unless the community tell me to do it yeah thank you very much enjoy thank you thatll keep you set for a little while really hard at the moment ive got myself as a diabetes and my son as a diabetes as well and fresh fruit and veg is really important so what happens when you cant get that or you cant afford that might do what we got to really be hard story and they have to charge through the nose with their prices which is not their fault its the way of living these days in the costume does this make you feel like youre part of the community thats because the whole community is being invited there you know and thats the great thing about it its not just for aboriginal and torres strait islanders for everyone and its nice to see other people coming here garys taking us on a tour of walgett the town hes called home for the past  years theres a lot of people out there less fortunate than us havent got the drive that me and my family have got and theyre the people that we need to help a lot of people fear to come here because its got a bad reputation back in the late s i was in accolade with the new south wales police yes it was a volunte town but now theres no one on the street no it might be an odd kid but thatll be about all so from the reputation that it had to what its got now i feel is really a credit to the wilder people well ill be honest with you ive had about three nights where ive had probably two or three hours sleep in the last week because i thought this wasnt gonna go the way that it was planned but the third go off the way that it went off this morning i think ive ground  foot tall youre saying it with your own eyes like wildwood police walgett ambulance walbert fire brigade and other people were just walking up to me and say gary can we helped i think its brought this town the relations between aboriginal and nonaboriginal i think its brought this town ahead  years really today yep modipaki serves a region that covers around  percent of the state where more than  percent of residents are aboriginal gary says moody parking knows what locals need and it delivers so how does that line up with the voice this is the worst thing dan theyre trying to put something on us and not telling us what its going to be and i will not support that i will not support people that are living in sydney to make decisions for me and my family listening to you about murray parkey im wondering well isnt that essentially a possibility to be a local regional voice that then feeds in so issues that are coming out of wall get come through you to your chair and then go to thats right that national body thats exactly right but your voice is only as good as the person thats representing you what gary hints at here is a recurring theme as skepticism or lack of trust that the proposal would make things better um sort of in between at the moment but i think ill vote yes anyway because if we can make good changes then so be it if its going to benefit our communities then weve all got to be in it and im even talking about knowing everybodys on people too weve all got to come together start telling the truth about whats happened in the past learn from it go forward why is that important to tell the truth and to learn from it for you well my father was taken as part of the stolen generation and is still affecting our family  government houses have been built in the town for aborigines and another  are to be completed and tenanted this year music vics story is the reality for many indigenous families where history is present every day music he was living on a mission with his parents and he went down looking for turtle eggs to get breaky foot for the family you know and the cobbles come along and took it and thats why theres a lot of angst with with police still today you know that um that blue uniform it was represents a lot and a lot of thats not good its only just now that we found proof that he was actually in kindred with that there was a lot ahead for a lot of years because you know we didnt know what would happen to him in the past isnt that really affected us as a family foreign music the voice dividers provided a platform for truth telling about our dark past but also stories of incredible resilience does rivers were community that brought community together on my side of riverwood across is around about  years ago we have a massacre so what happened was over  plus of our people were massacred for no reason at all they were blamed for killing a man that was even dead now  australia became known as a federation of states and all the talk of that time was australia is now spreading its wings and its expanding while australia was spreading its wings and its expanding for our people it was shrinking now if you look straight out you can see like a kidneyshaped storage tank come up and well do a bit more eh get your fans out because this is the best spot number people dont these fish traps to the time the land was created generations of member and other language groups have used and cared for them for thousands of years i think its sort of coming to me that a lot of what the europeans did to the aboriginals was actually taking their culture away and it wasnt just accidental so obviously what bradley said you know changed their location and stopped them practicing hunting and gathering so it was a deliberate attempt to wipe out their culture so the fish traps originally went  meters back up past that we are our people would use that rock to sharpen their tools and weapons for hunting see that flat rock down the bottom here were having a big national conversation right now about our past how we reconcile that and understand that now i wonder where do you see us on on the voice i feel um ignorant music yeah what i should vote because there doesnt seem to be a lot of detail i hear of indigenous groups who are really for it others that are dead against it um and i really just dont i dont know what im going to vote because i dont feel that ive got enough information um i think its important but i dont know what the right thing to do is what happens the day after if the vote is incredibly close or its not what we expect as a nation well its a really good question yeah its a really hard question um i mean it does seem that there is an element of divisiveness in the whole thing at the moment its not sort of bringing people together its um you know sort of driving a wedge i think for bay im definitely going to vote yet hopeful that it will be a vote for yes and i think that would be a really monumental change for australia and it would be a good step forward in reconciliation and i think enshrined in the constitution allows that it will continue despite what politics plays or what parliament does and i think that that is going to be a really big change here likes so much of australia people are focused on the daytoday of life paying the bills getting the kids to sport applause music applause foreign music had their first five children of the ten children that mum ended up having music and thats where we lived um on on the on the riverbank music ive had  children five boys and five girls and ive got a  grannies and great grannies and great great grannies even now like im semiretired nimble woman grace gordon has lived in and around brewerina all her life we were actually all came under the aboriginal protection act um at that time right up until  lots of different aboriginal grace found her voice in social welfare reform establishing womens safe houses shes had a lot of frustrating experiences trying to get support for local solutions its left her with a strong suspicion of government and its structures mark youre welcome here to my country which isnt nearby country and id like to pay my respects to our elders past and present and our young and emerging leaders that are coming through oh thank you so much grace so i was actually involved in this for quite some time around the establishment it was the first womens safehouse model which is a different model to the normal womens refuges and we had locations in lightning ridge wildgatt ruarana burke and wilkinia it was very personal for me you know um i i myself you know i was a victim of domestic violence and when that was happening to me we didnt have these types of services out in these remote communities women didnt really want to be you know putting their men in jail they didnt like the violence they wanted the violence to go away so we thought if we developed a model like this when the women knew that things were going to start to escalate that the women could ring and say you know wed like to come in for the weekend so you broke rules in order to protect women the policies and guidelines around places of that size was that you could only take at any one time six or seven people and as you know many of our first nation families that could be one woman thats got that number of children we did we we broke the rules if we needed to bring in  women we would bring them in and theyd sleep on the floor as the chair of moody parking ruarana grace can see indigenous voices need to be heard by decision makers but is skeptical about what an enshrined voice will deliver but if theres um so i would like to see more of people from our remote communities being i suppose involved in the hierarchy if you want to call it that and to be able to take our voices really to the table to get some real traction and real outcomes to be devils advocate is that what a voice to parliament is well well thats what theyre perceiving it to be but i still dont see that its in what we see as a real voice to parliament music there are road maps everywhere with answers to local problems have a beautiful day at school okay good morning music jason ford has wrestled with the best way forward my position on the voice to parliament is uh ive been directed by my direct elder um to vote now um and thats it is finished thats not once my elder tells me something ive got to respect what they say regardless i dont ask questions about that has that been complex or tough for you because well i know that youre a yes supporter yeah yeah well i look look i suppose you know like its its today is pretty complex you know and its something of me being able to showcase to my nieces and my nephews and that allows our family group to showcase you know that we still have that continuity to our nearby culture and our elders you know i just got to respect my culture and my elder and thats just the way it is how are you going to feel the day after the referendum ill feel for the people that have worked so hard to try and improve things for the people i feel for them if it doesnt get up and um and ill be happy for him if it gets up its the same point you know if it gets up ill still be happy for them because i respect what theyve done i just hope it doesnt change the way people treat us in a negative way hypers are positive outcome and either way either way music on the other side of the country in northern western australia other issues are muddying the waters northerns a great place weve got baladon history here for over   years and weve got european history almost for  years its a beautiful mural here oh its absolutely fantastic done by jackson stone wellknown artist chris antonio is northern shire president i grew up on the farm out of town so youre a little bit isolated from everything to be honest i think it was a racist town but i think that wasnt from any malicious intent it was just from ignorance people didnt know our history it wasnt taught at schools and we just didnt know and that was a lot of the population thank you applause this is a big weekend for the town today is the start of the avon river descent an annual twoday race from northern to perth i hope that you have an amazing race you are part of history this is the th avenue descent the avon descent is a community event davis is here to bless the river before the race begins when we go for a swimmer when you think we always throw sand into the water and thats to let the rival know that were going into his domain no one knows what hes looked like this just does like a rainbow serpent and he lives in this river down the rise before i wish you the best if its your first time good luck music weve worked really hard on embracing our cultural heritage and weve also made it possible to be comfortable to have uncomfortable conversations northerns maturing debate made it ready for the voice proposal music then earlier this year the west australian government introduced new legislation aimed at protecting aboriginal cultural heritage it was meant to prevent the type of destruction mining company rio tinto caused in  when it blew up duke and gorge a racing   years of indigenous heritage music but the new laws made no one happy so their interests and concerns and the government repealed them after only five weeks it was never the intention the failure of the new laws has cast a shadow over the voice debate in the west please show some respect here applause and normally nationals member of parliament for the central wheat belt mia davies is a northern local and a member of western australias opposition very early on in the pace i could see people linking the two and i tried very hard to make the point to the government that the way they were going about it was was creating confusion and chaos and setting people against the the broader debate around the voice that was dismissed we were called racist in the debate we were told that we were conflating the two issues but we could see that was happening on the ground in the community and it was making it harder to have those conversations without a doubt some people play on that politically i was trying to actually keep the two issues separate tony seabrook farms up river of northam in his role as president of the wa pastoralist and graziers association seabrook was instrumental in the campaign that overthrew the cultural heritage law hes been here since day dot our family cleared the country i have a very deep sense of attachment to my piece of country it was a mound in the ground when i was a child as tony shows me around his property he notes the hardships of early pastoralists that family had a child that was scolded the child died on the way to town and i buried that baby just outside the walls of the house place where that house was where that baby that the child was buried is that a special place have you protected that i have never been there without thinking of whats here so i could take you to within a very close distance of where the child is buried but unfortunately the ring of stones that were there were taken away whose feelings have parallels with how first nations people in the west regard their sacred sides do you know if there are any first nations sites of interest on your property and i have been over every inch of this farm and i can tell you right now i havent found a single thing that would indicate that there had been any indigenous presence here at any time in the past i couldnt find one im an absolute advocate for the preservation of heritage but this concept of um mythical serpents and while i start to have a problem when this cultural belief impinges upon the sorts of things that i as a farmer need to do and id encompass that with everybody that owns land applause the heritage act roused campaigners such as tony to insist their concern to be heard your organization the wa partialists and gracie is association has a voice to parliament youre incredibly influential do you see a parallel between what the voices we have a we fight we fight for every inch of of their play and influence that we have isnt that what a voice to parliament would be a place where aboriginal torres strait islander people can have the fight so that theyre heard the way that you are i dont think anyone can say no ones listening everybody is listening this is a tokenistic gesture that wont change anything music mia davies led her party when the wa nationals decided to back the voice proposal the same week the federal party voted to oppose it its heartened that our party was prepared to have that debate and that there were people that wanted to see change in the way that we did aboriginal policy for the betterment not only of aboriginal people but for our whole nation shes concerned that the abandoned heritage actors cast a shadow over the voice debate theres no doubt that the aboriginal cultural heritage act has made it more difficult for people to consider whats being asked of in the referendum and thats really disappointing last month the local party fell into line with the federal no position you and i have talked about some of the really intractable challenges that some aboriginal torres strait islander people face one of the reasons used to justify the voice is that there needs to be a new way of trying to deal and address those matters we need to address this but we dont need to add it to the constitution this is a simple thing that the legislation is there today to do that theres nearly five percent of the federal parliament that is indigenous the population of australia deems itself to be indigenous a bit over three percent theyre not unrepresented if anything the people that represent them and call themselves indigenous are letting them down what do you mean by those that call themselves indigenous well theres a big problem here you know youve been up north and you clearly know what someone that is indigenous looks like but we dont have any way here today in australia of saying if someone says theyre indigenous thats it they are but theres a threepoint test and is anyone going to contest that is anyone going to contest the fact that someone call themselves indigenous i think its challenged every day i make the simple argument that what were doing now is simply not working and ive seen that in every corner of western australia and we will only get one chance i think to recognize aboriginal people in our constitution yes yes i will be voting yes athletes coming across the line after two days of racing the avon descent ends here in suburban perth competitors are spent from the effort but if its a metaphor for the voice campaign it ends there that result is still far from clear music s music again to stay at the finish line in this year battling out for line honors so ive never proclaimed and i dont have a decision of yes or no i want to see more information so i can make my mind up when i think its relevant and all the information is in front of me music if the cultural heritage act is a lesson in how not to do policy reform examples exist of how to do things better wa southwest native title agreement known by many is the noongar treaty shows how real consultations can lead to tangible outcomes colin barnett was the liberal premier who signed the deal man brendan moore now helps ensure it delivers music its not a small deal that was negotiated and i think its a great pity

for aboriginal people it was a big deal a lot of people said to me its taking a long time five years of negotiation is a long time my response was understand for nungo people this is the one roll of
